Notes
On some other systems, the default path (used when the environment does not contain the variable PATH)
has the current working directory listed after /bin and /usr/bin, as an anti-Trojan-horse measure.
Linux uses here the traditional "current directory first" default path.
The behavior of execlp() and execvp() when errors occur while attempting to execute the file is historic practice, 
but has not traditionally been documented and is not specified by the POSIX standard. 
BSD (and possibly other systems) do an automatic sleep and retry if ETXTBSY is encountered. 
Linux treats it as a hard error and returns immediately.
Traditionally, 
the functions execlp() and execvp() ignored all errors except for the ones described above and ENOMEM and E2BIG, 
upon which they returned. 
They now return if any error other than the ones described above occurs.
